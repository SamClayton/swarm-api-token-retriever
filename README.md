# Swarm API Token Retriever

A simple Node.js webservice to retrieve a Foursquare Swarm OAuth token for the user.

Currently deployed at [https://swarm-api-token-retriever.glitch.me/](https://swarm-api-token-retriever.glitch.me/)

Simply click the link, log in, and the key will appear in the browser.

I built this as a replacement for the defunct service that enables
[dogsheep/swarm-to-sqlite](https://github.com/dogsheep/swarm-to-sqlite), a 
CLI Python app to retrieve and store an SQLite database (and, optionally, a JSON file) of a user's 
FourSquare Swarm check-in history.
